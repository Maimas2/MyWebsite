        <h2>LaTeX Class for Bills</h2>
        <p>As a fun side project, I made a LaTeX class for typesetting bills for my Model Congress club. There wasn't one I could find on CTAN or anything, so I made a simple one. It's <b>not</b> a good class; there's no documentation or options or anything like that. There's a small example file included with it (originally made for Waterford Model Congress), but that's all. In my arrogant opinion, it didn't come out too shabby.</p>

        <h2>Satire video thing</h2>
        <p>In AP Lang, we all made a short satire piece satirizing <i>something</i>. I satirized government surveillance (as people do), and made a two-minute video for it. There's not much else to say.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 80%;">Due to this website being on a free-tier AWS server, I'm not serving any video files myself. Sorry.</p>

        <h2>Raisin in the Sun set video</h2>
        <p>We read <i>A Raisin in the Sun</i> our sophomore year in english. We were given a choice of a bunch of things to do for the project, and I chose to make a set design in Blender. I do love Blender (and not just because it's open-source), and I'm really glad I was able to do something in it. It came out... fine for a sophomore. Don't expect too much, I am not an expert with visual design or anything adjacent.</p>

        <h2>Leechfield Constitution</h2>
        <p>Working at June Norcross Webster Scout Reservation over the summer, the area of Staff Row I lived in became a small democratic government, and I made a short constitution to outline the government. It is tailored for our group of maybe eight people; there is really only one branch and everything was exclusively self-governing. Still, it was a really fun project to do, and I hope that someday I'll make another constitution for an actual country, not just an eight-person direct democracy. The physical document is typeset in LaTeX using a modified version of the bill class above.</p>

        <h2>Carillon by Georges Bizet</h2>
        <p>We played the First Arlesienne Suite by Georges Bizet at Connecticut Eastern Regions Festival my freshman year. That is an amazing suite of music, and I loved every moment of it, especially the fourth movement Carillon. A while later, I was wanting to learn how to use <a href="https://lmms.io/">LMMS</a>, and decided to try to recreate Carillon in it (LMMS is <b>not</b> meant to be used for Classical music, you'll note). It took about an afternoon, much quicker than I thought, although in fairness it only includes the second half of the movement.</p>

        <h2>Random piano themes</h2>
        <p>Here are a bunch of random short melodies on the piano. I am not a composer, so they're not complex or particularly good, but I like to think that they aren't too horrible, at least for a first ever. I don't really know what to say for this one, it's pretty mundane. It was made and rendered in MuseScore.</p>

        <h2>Dominion card designer</h2>
        <p>Dominion by Donald X. Vaccarino is a really fun game and I would recommend it to everyone. There is a good card designer <a href="https://shardofhonor.github.io/dominion-card-generator/">here</a> (which is, has been, and will be better than mine), but I wanted to try to make my own as a desktop app. It is made with <a href="https://www.glfw.org/">GLFW</a> and OpenGL, while also using <a href="https://curl.se/">cURL</a> and <a href="https://freetype.org/">Freetype</a>. All written in C++, the goated language. This is an older project, and I never set it up to really work on other systems. After all, "it works on my machine!" It doesn't really work on Windows at all, and I have no clue about MacOS or anything else. I made it on my small Linux Mint laptop and never looked back.</p>
