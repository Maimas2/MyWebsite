PageDescription:Result of Two Plates Colliding Head-On
SubtopicName:Boundary Types

Two tectonic plates moving towards each other results in a __bold__convergent boundary__. At such a site, one plate will generally __b__subduct__ under the other and fall into the mantle. It then melts, resulting in a destruction of crust.

As the plate is subducting, it can build up energy in the form of compression over many years, then release it all in the span of a minute in an __nlink__earthquake__Earthquake__.
