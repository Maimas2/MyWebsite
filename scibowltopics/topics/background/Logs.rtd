__knowledge__Logarithms can be a difficult concept to grasp for the unfamiliar. There are better explanations of them out on the internet, if this one doesn't work for you.__

The __b__logarithm__ is the inverse of the exponential function; a logarithm "undoes" an exponential:

\[ a^x=b \to \log_a b = x \]
\[ \log_a\left( a^x \right)=x \]

Just like exponentials, logarithms have a base.
