For a majority of a star's lifetime, it is in its __b__main sequence__, fusing elements in its core to keep itself from being crushed by the layers on top of it. This typical stage takes up a majority a star's life, and it is the stage that our Sun is in.

Throughout this stage, the star __nlink__fuses__Fusion__ hydrogen in its core to produce helium and lots of heat. This heat keeps the extremely heavy star from collapsing in on itself, a balance known as __nlink__hydrostatic equilibrium__Hydrostatic Equilibrium__.
