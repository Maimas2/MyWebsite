PageDescription:The balance between the inward and outward forces in a star
SubtopicName:

A star is constantly in a delicate balance between two opposing forces in itself. First, gravity tries to pull the entire star inwards under its own weight. The force opposing it is the energy being produced by the __nlink__fusion__Fusion__ at the star's core.

Because gravity produces the pressure which causes the fusion, this equilibrium acts as a dampener to any expansions or contractions in the star. If the star contracts, the core is pressurized more, which produces more energy, which pushes the star outwards. Conversely, if the star expands, the core's fusion will weaken, causing the star to contract.
