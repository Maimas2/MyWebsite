PageDescription:Everyone speaks
SubtopicName:Motions

A __b__round robin__ is a type of speech in which every delegate is able to speak on a specific topic, usually for a very short duration. Typical delegate speaking times are around ten to twenty seconds. Normally, the committee just goes around in a circle, but the Chair may decide another order of speaking if they desire.

For example, to propose a round robin on banning fracking, in which each delegate has fifteen seconds to speak, a delegate would say:

__examplemotion__I move for a fifteen second round robin on the prohibition of fracking.__
