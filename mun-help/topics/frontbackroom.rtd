All debate in Model UN can be classified as either __b__frontroom__ or __b__backroom__.

The __b__frontroom__ is any debate that occurs in public, for the entire committee to see. This comprises the __nlink__speakers list__speakers-list__, __nlink__mods__mod__, and __nlink__resolutions__resolutions__. The frontroom dominates in General Assembly-type committees.

The __b__backroom__ is any discussion that is not public. For General Assemblies, this is usually only __nlink__unmods__unmod__ and is much less significant that frontroom debate. In specialized or crisis committees, however, the backroom also includes any crisis notes passed in, which dramatically expands its importance.
