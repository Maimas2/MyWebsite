        <h2>Junior year research paper</h2>
        <p>In AP Lang, we all wrote a 3-4,000 word research paper about a bill presented to the Congress, arguing for or against its passage. I chose <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/792">H.R. 792 of the 119th Congress</a>, which would add Trump's face to Mount Rushmore. I argued against its passage (it never even came up in committee). The original paper was submitted on Google Docs, though I reformatted it using LaTeX for this.</p>

        <h2>Sophomore year research paper</h2>
        <p>In our sophomore english classes, we wrote a 3-4,000 word research paper about some facet of contemporary society and its potential effects for the future. I chose to write about book bans. I focused more on the legal and constitutional parts of the debacle (though I only got so deep as a sophomore). While we were told to remain relatively unbiases, I did not do an excellent job at that. The original paper was submitted on Google Docs.</p>

        <p>In my senior year, I am taking a Journalism class. My first major article of the year was a profile of Nick Gauthier, who was elected the year before to his first term as state representative in the CT House of Reps. </p>
