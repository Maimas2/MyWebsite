        <h2>YMUN LII Position Paper</h2>
        <p>In my senior year, I attended the Yale Model UN program from 15-18 Jan. 2026. I had the fortune of being in a crisis committee, in which I played the (fictional) Cardinal Oskar Gruber through the Papal Conclave following Pope Francis' death and debating Church policy beyond. Before the conference, I wrote a position paper to outline my position on the topics before the committee. It is formatted in LaTeX.</p>

        <h2>Senior year research paper</h2>
        <p>In AP Lit, we all wrote research papers connecting a thread of Mary Shelley's <i>Frankenstein</i> to a relevant piece of the modern world. Beyond that, the requirements were few and far between; the most notable was us needing to include at least two multimodal aspects. For my theme, I chose to connect marriages and close relationships in <i>Frankenstein</i> to the changes in marriage in today's society. The original assignment was submitted through Google Docs; I also reformatted it with LaTeX.</p>

        <h2>Junior year research paper</h2>
        <p>In AP Lang, we all wrote a 3-4,000 word research paper about a bill presented to the Congress, arguing for or against its passage. I chose <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/792">H.R. 792 of the 119th Congress</a>, which would add Trump's face to Mount Rushmore. I argued against its passage (though the bill died in committee). The original paper was submitted on Google Docs, though I reformatted it using LaTeX for this.</p>

        <h2>Sophomore year research paper</h2>
        <p>In our sophomore english classes, we wrote a 3-4,000 word research paper about some facet of contemporary society and its potential effects for the future. I chose to write about book bans. I focused more on the legal and constitutional parts of the debacle (though I only got so deep as a sophomore). While we were told to remain relatively unbiases, I did not do an excellent job at that. The original paper was submitted on Google Docs.</p>
